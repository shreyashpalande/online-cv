  title: Summary
  summary: |
    I am a robotics enthusiast inspired by the field of Self Adaptive Systems, 
    Situational aware robots, Meta-cognitive controllers and Knowledge representation and reasoning
education:
  - degree: MSc in Systems and Control
    university: Delft University of Technology
    time: 2018 - 2020
    details: |
      Thesis: "Situational-Aware mobile robot localization system: A Knowledge Representation and Reasoning approach" at AIRLab Delf
        - Reusable semantic models of hardware and software components in form of ontology/knowledge graph to satisfy functional and non-functional requirements of the localization system
        - Perform automated reasoning over the knowledge using real-time data to improve self-awareness and context-awareness of the localization system
        - Implement MAPE-K feedback loop for self-adaptation in case of runtime faults/failures and violation of performance requirements
        - This project was a part of AIRLab Delft (TU Delft-Ahold Delhaize industry lab) which aims at developing robotic solutions for retail supply chain, from warehouses and stores to customers
  - degree: Bachelor of Electronics Engineering
    university: University of Mumbai
    time: 2014 - 2018
    details: |
      Bachelor Project: "Geo-Mapping of Chemicals and Micro-Biological Parameters of Watershed"
        - Developed portable mobile station to perform chemical analysis of water within minutes
        - Developed a method to automatically detect the concentration of colonies of E.coli in water using image
        - Validated the work by performing chemical analysis of water from Bhavan’s Lake (Andheri, Mumbai) with 92% match with lab results
        - The project was selected for poster presentations an international conference on “Sustainable Solutions Implemented To Provide Safe Drinking Waters 
          To Rural And Urban Communities” organised by the Department of Microbiology and Bhavan’s Research Center under the aegis of Bhavan’s College, Andheri, Mumbai.
